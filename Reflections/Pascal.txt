Binomial Co-efficients C(n,k) is the co-efficients if x^k in the expansion (1+x)^k.
Pascal's Triangle Entries are the binomial co-efficients.
The Binomial Co-efficients can be calculated using the following 3 methods:
-Recursion
-Dynamic Programming (2-D Array)
-Dynamic Programming (1-D Array)

-Recursion 
This involves calling back the function again for all values.
Diadvantage:
Uses lot of Stack space.
Uses lot of Processor time
Advantages:
Shorter code

-2D array DP
-The values are computed and stored in a 2 d arrat. so there is no need to calculate it all again for a value which is covered.
For eg: C(10,5) calculates all the previous values. But in case of recursion, the values are again calculated, each time it is asked.

1D Array Dp
-The values are computed each time from the previous values. Most Optimal as it overites the existing array and gets the new values by adding 
to the previous value.
