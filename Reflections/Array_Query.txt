1.Look up Table
-Space Complexity : n2
-Time to fetch a value :constant time O(1)
-Time complexity of the program : n2

Applications of Look up Table :
      - Sum in array
      - Minimum no in array
      - Maximum no in array
   

2. Square root Decomposition
- Array is split into smaller blocks.
- The size of the array is Square root(length) and the index of the smallest element of that range is stored.
- Time complexity is O(n) for the array and O(squareroot(n)) for the smaller decomposed array.



3. Segment Tree
- This is used only when there is no updation. i.e. It is static.
- It is a strictly binary tree (Complete binary tree with 2 or 0 child).
- The complexity is O(logn).
